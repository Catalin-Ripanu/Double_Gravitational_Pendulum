# HW2_FC

# Variant 1 (Low Difficulty)

Construct a program, based on the model from the meeting, that approximately reproduces the illustration of the chaotic evolution from the previously provided link.

Note: Three identical double pendulums will be simulated simultaneously, with slightly different initial conditions.

# Variant 2 (Medium Difficulty) 

Construct a program, based on the model from the meeting, that simulates the motion of a triple gravitational pendulum.

# Variant 3 (High Difficulty)

Construct a program, based on the model from the meeting, that simulates the motion of a double gravitational pendulum, maintaining the total energy constant through active control of the calculated angular velocities in recursion.

Note: The algorithm must monitor the total energy at each step and contain a mechanism to compensate for any numerical tendencies (method errors) of increase/decrease.
